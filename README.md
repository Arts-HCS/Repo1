# Python Discord Snippets

This is a small collection of Python scripts I’ve written while experimenting with the `discord.py` library and other basic features like `random`. It’s not a full project, but more of a sandbox to test ideas, build simple bots, and try out small Python concepts.

## What's Inside?

- Discord bot commands and event handlers using `discord.py`
- Random-based  utilities using Python’s `random` module
- Helpful snippets for future projects

## Requirements

Some scripts require:

- Python 3.10+
- `discord.py` library (`pip install discord.py`)
